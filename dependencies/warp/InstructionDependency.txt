 Getting warp from Nuget gets us 
 "Could not install package 'Microsoft.Direct3D.WARP 1.0.11'. 
 You are trying to install this package into a project that targets 'native,Version=v0.0', 
 but the package does not contain any assembly references or content files that are compatible with that framework. 
 For more information, contact the package author"
 So instead we download the package manually with:
 Invoke-WebRequest -Uri httpswww.nuget.orgapiv2packageMicrosoft.Direct3D.WARP1.0.11 -OutFile warp.zip
 Then copy d3d10warp.dll to the executable
